            <section Id="A"><b>ABOUT</b><br>
                Flipkart Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bangalore, and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially focused on online book sales before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.[5][6]

The service competes primarily with Amazon India and domestic rival Snapdeal.[7][8] As of FY23, Flipkart held a 48% market share in the Indian e-commerce industry.[9] Flipkart has a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra, and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[10]

            <p>In 2011, Flipkart acquired the digital distribution business Mime360.com[19] and the digital content library of the Bollywood portal Chakpak.[20] Following the acquisition, Flipkart launched its DRM-free Digital music store Flyte in 2012. Due to competition from free streaming sites, Flyte was unsuccessful and shut down in June 2013.[21][22][23][24] Mime360 was a content distributor that used HTTP-based encryption technology that allows for fast and secure data delivery. It distributed music, media and games using its distribution platform.[25]

                With its eyes on India's retail market, Flipkart acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer,[26] in 2012, and Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for US$280 million in May 2014.[27] Myntra continues to operate alongside Flipkart as a standalone subsidiary focusing on separate market segment</p>
