<h1>GIT(Global Information Tracking)</h1>
<p>The latest stable release of Git is version 2.48.1, which was released on January 14, 2025.<br>Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) used for tracking changes in files and coordinating work among multiple people. It is widely used in software development but can be applied to any project that requires version tracking.<br>
Three stages in git:-<br>
<b>1. Working Directory (Untracked/Modified State)</b><br>
The Working Directory is the place where you actively work on files. It contains the actual files and directories that you can see and edit in your project folder.<br>

<b>Purpose:</b>
This stage is where you make changes to your project, such as creating, modifying, or deleting files.<br>
<b>State:</b>
Files in this stage are either untracked.<br>

<b>command:</b> Git status.<br>
<b>2. Staging Area (Index)</b><br>
The Staging Area is an intermediate space where you prepare changes before committing them to the repository.<br>

<b>Purpose:</b>
It acts as a buffer between your working directory and the repository, allowing you to review and selectively stage changes for a commit.<br>
<b>State:</b>
Files in the staging area are marked as ready to be committed. You can stage individual files or specific changes.<br>
<b>Commands:</b>git add filename/git add .<br>
<b>3. Repository (Committed State)</b><br>
The Repository is where all committed changes are stored in Git's database, forming the version history.
<br>
<b>Purpose:</b>
This stage ensures that your changes are saved permanently, along with metadata such as the author, timestamp, and a commit message.<br>
<b>State:</b>
Files in the repository are part of the projectâ€™s official history and can be accessed or shared.
<br>
<b>command:</b>git commit -m"msg"/git log
