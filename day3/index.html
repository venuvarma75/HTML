<h1><center>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR(URL)</center></h1>
<h2>URL Structure</h2>  <br>
<b>1. Scheme (Protocal)</b>
The scheme (also called protocol) tells web servers which protocol to use when it accesses a page on your website.
Nowadays, HTTPS — which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure — is the most common scheme. It tells your web browser to encrypt any information you enter onto the page, like your passwords or credit card information, so cybercriminals can’t access it. This security protocol protects your website visitors and implementing it will help your site rank better on Google. That's why implementing SSL is a must-do on any technical SEO guide.
</br>
<br>
<b>2. Subdomain</b>
A subdomain in a URL indicates which particular page of your website the web browser should serve up.
For instance, subdomains like “blog” or “offers” will provide your website’s blog page or offers page.

Subdomains also bucket your website into its main content categories and shows Google and your visitors that there's more information on your site than just a homepage.
</br>
<br>
<b>3. Second-level Domain</b>
second-level domain (SLD) is the name of your website. It helps people know they’re visiting a certain brand’s site. For instance, people who visit “mlb.com” know they’re on Major League Baseball’s website, without needing any more information.
</br>
<br>

<b>4. Top-level Domain</b>
The top-level domain (TLD) specifies what type of entity your organization registers as on the internet.
For example, “.com” is intended for commercial entities in the United States, so a lot of American businesses register with a top-level domain of “.com”. Similarly “.edu” is intended for academic institutions in the United States, so a lot of American colleges and universities register with a top-level domain of “.edu”.
</br>
<br>

<b>5. Subdirectory</b>
A subdirectory — also known as a subfolder — helps people as well as web crawlers understand which particular section of a webpage they’re on.

For instance, if you own an online store that sells t-shirts, hats, and mugs, one of your website’s URLs could look like “https://shop.yourstore.com/hats”. Notice that the subdomain is “shop” and the subdirectory is “hats." That means this URL would serve up the “Hats” page, which is a subfolder of the “Shop” page. T-shirts and mugs would be other subfolders of this page.
</br>

<br>
<b>6. Port</b>
The port is a number used to specify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service. Different servers will use different port numbers. This number is always associated with a host network address, like an IP address. For example an HTTP server is identified using 80, while an HTTPS server uses 443 as its port number.
</br>

<br>
<b>7. Path</b>
The path specifies the location of the file or resource that the user wants to access. In the example below, the specified path would be the article “parth-url.”
</br>


<h1> <center>AGILE METHODOLOGY</center></h1>
   
<p>The Agile methodology is a project management and software development approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centricity. It is the latest model used by major companies today like Facebook, google, amazon, etc. It follows the iterative as well as incremental approach that emphasizes the importance of delivering of working product very quickly.</p>


<h1>Life cycle of Agile Methodology</h1>
<br>
<b>1. Requirement Gathering</b>
In this stage, the project team identifies and documents the needs and expectations of various stakeholders, including clients, users, and subject matter experts.
It involves defining the project's scope, objectives, and requirements.
Establishing a budget and schedule.
Creating a project plan and allocating resources.
</br>
<br>

<b>2. Design</b>
Developing a high-level system architecture.
Creating detailed specifications, which include data structures, algorithms, and interfaces.
Planning for the software's user interface.
</br>
<br>
<b>3. Development (Coding)</b>
Writing the actual code for the software. Conducting unit testing to verify the functionality of individual components.
</br>
<br>
<b>4. Testing</b>
This phase involves several types of testing:

Integration Testing: Ensuring that different components work together.
System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.
User Acceptance Testing: Confirming that the software meets user requirements.
Performance Testing: Assessing the system's speed, scalability, and stability
</br>
<br>
<b>5. Deployment</b>
Deploying the software to a production environment.
Put the software into the real world where people can use it.
Make sure it works smoothly in the real world.
Providing training and support for end-users.
</br>
<br>
<b>6. Review (Maintenance)</b>
Addressing and resolving any issues that may arise after deployment.
Releasing updates and patches to enhance the software and address problems.
</br>




<h1><center>WATERFALL METHODOLOGY</center></h1>

The Waterfall methodology also known as the Waterfall model is a sequential development process that flows like a waterfall through all phases of a project (analysis, design, development, and testing, for example), with each phase completely wrapping up before the next phase begins.
It is said that the Waterfall methodology follows the adage to “measure twice, cut once.” The success of the Waterfall method depends on the amount and quality of the work done on the front end, documenting everything in advance, including the user interface, user stories, and all the features’ variations and outcomes.
With the majority of the research done upfront, estimates of the time needed for each requirement are more accurate, and this can provide a more predictable release date. With a Waterfall project, if parameters change along the way, it’s harder to change course than it is with Agile methodology.










<h1><center>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)</center></h1>
<p>Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step. The goal of the SDLC life cycle model is to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that meets the user’s requirements. SDLC in software engineering models outlines the plan for each stage so that each stage of the software development model can perform its task efficiently to deliver the software at a low cost within a given time frame that meets users requirements.</p>


<b>Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle</b>
<br>

<b>The SDLC Model involves six phases or stages while developing any software.</b>
</br>
<br>
<b>Stage-1: Planning and Requirement Analysis</b>
Planning is a crucial step in everything, just as in software development. In this same stage, requirement analysis is also performed by the developers of the organization. This is attained from customer inputs, and sales department/market surveys.
</br>
<br>
<b>Stage-2: Defining Requirements</b>
In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. 
This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS (Software Requirement Specification). This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined and created during the entire project cycle. 
</br>
<br>
<b>Stage-3: Designing Architecture</b>

SRS is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with the requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design Document Specification (DDS). 

This DDS is assessed by market analysts and stakeholders. After evaluating all the possible factors, the most practical and logical design is chosen for development.
</br>
<br>
<b>Stage-4: Developing Product</b>
At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS. Hence, it is important for the coders to follow the protocols set by the association. Conventional programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are also put into use at this stage. Some popular languages like C/C++, Python, Java, etc. are put into use as per the software regulations.
</br>
<br>
<b>Stage-5: Product Testing and Integration</b>
After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution. Although, minimal testing is conducted at every stage of SDLC. Therefore, at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested. This ensures that the product confronts the quality requirements of SRS. 

Documentation, Training, and Support: Software documentation is an essential part of the software development life cycle. A well-written document acts as a tool and means to information repository necessary to know about software processes, functions, and maintenance. Documentation also provides information about how to use the product. Training in an attempt to improve the current or future employee performance by increasing an employee’s ability to work through learning, usually by changing his attitude and developing his skills and understanding.
</br>
<br>
<b>Stage-6: Deployment and Maintenance of Products</b>
After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the organization’s strategy. Then it is tested in a real industrial environment. It is important to ensure its smooth performance. If it performs well, the organization sends out the product as a whole. After retrieving beneficial feedback, the company releases it as it is or with auxiliary improvements to make it further helpful for the customers. However, this alone is not enough.

<h1><center>AMAZON WEB SERVICES</center></h1>


Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis. Clients will often use this in combination with autoscaling (a process that allows a client to use more computing in times of high application usage, and then scale down to reduce costs when there is less traffic). These cloud computing web services provide various services related to networking, compute, storage, middleware, IoT and other processing capacity, as well as software tools via AWS server farms. This frees clients from managing, scaling, and patching hardware and operating systems. One of the foundational services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, with extremely high availability, which can be interacted with over the internet via REST APIs, a CLI or the AWS console. AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk (HDD)/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM)
   <h1><center>DEVOPS</center></h1>

DevOps is a methodology integrating and automating the work of software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops). It serves as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.DevOps is complementary to agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile approach.

Automation is an important part of DevOps. Software programmers and architects should use "fitness functions" to keep their software in check.

According to Neal Ford, DevOps, particularly through continuous delivery, employs the "Bring the pain forward" principle, tackling tough tasks early, fostering automation and swift issue detection.
